## Reporting BBDK Issues

* Check that you're running the latest version found here: http://arcade.facepunch.com/downloads
* Make sure you've looked at the list of open issues to check that your problem hasn't already been reported.
* Please provide information about the device you encountered the issue on, particularly your operating system and graphics card model.
* Provide steps to reproduce the issue whenever possible. Try to keep this as simple as possible.
* As an extension to the above, it would help us immensely if you could attach a minimal example to your issue. This can be a code snippet or, preferably, a zip file containing a game that will demonstrate the problem.
